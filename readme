Team Stats
I want to create and extract information about Muriel.io racing sports team. Itâ€™s my job to create data using the JavaScript data structures at my disposal: arrays, objects, etc.

I can manipulate these data structures as well as gain insights from them. For example, I might want to get the total number of games/races my team has played, or the average score of all of their games.
